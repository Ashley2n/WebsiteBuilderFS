# Ralyale Listings Website Builder

A static web app for browsing Clash Royale card listings. Built with vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, it loads card data from a JSON file and displays interactive cards with modal details.

## Features

- Card grid view with images, stats, and rarity
- Modal pop-up for detailed card info
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- No build step or dependenciesâ€”just open `index.html` in your browser
